# The-Greater-Than-Gators

I worked on the Frontend of the game. I made the player class, boss class, and the world class. 

A 2D Platform game designed to improve elementary level students' math skills!

Our platformer is a level where the user attempts to encounter the enemy, or boss, where they will be presented a math problem. The player then has to answer the math problem to "defeat" the boss.

Our platformer uses the Python module PyGame to provide a GUI for the user. Players can use WASD buttons to move and must collide with the boss to prompt the math question or boss encounter.
